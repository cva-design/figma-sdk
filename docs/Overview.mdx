# Packages

This is (for now) a roadmap of the packages we'll publish. These have been created to help us manage the complexity of the [CVA plugin](https://cva.design) project,
but have yet to be extracted into their own packages.

#### ğŸ“¦ UI

Published as `@cva.design/figma-sdk`, in the future, this will be an umbrella package and the UI stuff will be published under `@figma-plugin-sdk/ui`.

- ğŸŸ¢ Components
- ğŸŸ¡ Icons (needs documentation)
- ğŸŸ¡ Tokens (needs documentation)
  - Figmaâ€™s Plugin Tokens
    > The tokens Figma makes available to plugins.
  - Figmaâ€™s Internal Tokens
    > The tokens used by internally Figma in their app, a much bigger set than the plugin ones.

##### Plugin â†” UI Communication

#### ğŸ“¦ RPC

ğŸŸ¡ In beta

Check out the [RPC package](./rpc) for more information.

#### ğŸ“¦ Message Bus

ğŸš© Comming soon.

A message bus in typescript with fully typed messages and handlers. Messages can be either an async `Event` or a sync `Command`.
They can be dispatched from the plugin to the UI and vice versa.

##### Testing

#### ğŸ“¦ RunRun ğŸš©

Allows us to run tests inside figma, using a bootstrapped document and with access to the Figma API.
