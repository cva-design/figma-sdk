# Figma Message Bus

A TypeScript package providing a robust, type-safe message bus for communication between the Figma plugin main thread and its UI context. It simplifies event handling and command execution across contexts, including support for standard Figma API events and custom events/commands.

Includes utilities for serializing/deserializing complex data types (like `Map`) across the communication channel.

Built with TypeScript for strong typing and ECMAScript support.
